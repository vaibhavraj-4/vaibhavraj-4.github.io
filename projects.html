              Designed and implemented a sophisticated React-based dynamic form
              to efficiently gather comprehensive infrastructure requirements
              from users. The form features intuitive questions tailored to
              determine the optimal technologies for building and deploying
              applications, enhancing user experience and accuracy in capturing
              project needs.<br />
              Integrated a robust backend API using Python and Django for
              seamless form submission and real-time updates. Leveraged Google
              Gemini LLM with advanced prompt engineering to deliver actionable
              content, improving the precision of infrastructure
              recommendations.<br />
              Enabled interactive modifications to the generated infrastructure
              design through a chat interface. Users can easily adjust the
              content without repetitive information entry, leading to a 40%
              reduction in manual input and increasing user satisfaction by
              30%.<br />
              Implemented real-time context saving to ensure smooth transitions
              and modifications without losing previous inputs, thus enhancing
              the application's responsiveness and user engagement.
              <br />
              Introduced High-Level Design (HLD) generation feature, providing
              users with a visual overview of their service architecture. This
              feature has resulted in a 25% improvement in project planning
              accuracy and has been well-received for its clarity in presenting
              infrastructure layouts.

            <img src="projects/DALL¬∑E 2024-12-23 19.17.40 - A futuristic setup illustrating an automated waste segregation system. The scene includes a smart conveyor belt where waste items like bottles, papers.webp" alt="Project Image" />
            <p>The <strong>Automated Waste Segregation System</strong> is a machine learning-based solution that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify waste into two categories: <strong>Organic</strong> and <strong>Recyclable</strong>. The system automates the waste sorting process, enhancing recycling efficiency and promoting proper disposal practices. It features a simple web interface where users can upload images of waste items, which are then classified in real-time by the backend powered by Flask. The system provides instant classification results along with recycling recommendations, helping reduce contamination in recycling streams and encouraging environmentally-friendly practices. This system is efficient, scalable, and user-friendly, making it an effective tool for improving waste management at various scales.</p>
